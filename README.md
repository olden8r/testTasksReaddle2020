Test task 1 (HTTP, APIs, time)

Use 3rd-party JSON API: https://date.nager.at/PublicHoliday/Country/UA

Write a console application that prints if it’s a holiday today (and the name of it). If today isn’t a holiday, the application should print the next closest holiday. 

Additionally, if the holiday is adjacent to a weekend (so that amount of non-working days is extended), the application should print this information. I.e. the next holiday is May 1, Friday, and it’s adjacent to Saturday (May 2) and Sunday (May 3), so the application should print something like: “The next holiday is International Workers' Day, May 1, and the weekend will last 3 days: May 1 - May 3”.

P.S. A candidate is expected to calculate long weekends manually, without using any other 3rd-party API, except the one with national holidays.


Test task 2 (MySQL)

Download and install the Employee sample database (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/employees-installation.html).

Structure: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/sakila-structure.html.

Create queries:

  1. Find all current managers of each department and display his/her title, first name, last name, current salary.

  2. Find all employees (department, title, first name, last name, hire date, how many years they have been working) to congratulate them on their hire anniversary this month.

  3. Find all departments, their current employee count, their current sum salary.

Expected result:
Runnable Go application with required functionality implemented.
